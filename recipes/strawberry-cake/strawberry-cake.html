    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This fuss-free strawberry shortcake made in a pan eliminates much of the hassle and mess of traditional strawberry shortcakes. Instead of flouring the counter and rolling and cutting out individual shortcakes, you'll bake one giant skillet biscuit-like cake that's topped with macerated strawberries and whipped cream. Perfect for celebrating the arrival of warmer, sunnier days.</p>
